- A simple, yet effective percentage change calculator. Interface is designed to cater towards calculating very simple Stock Price changes to investors to calculate their simple-return; however, it can be used for any percentage-change purpose regardless.

- The user can very easily type in their initial and final value then press calculate. The user will then be met with the resulting data with a satisfying visual change in the interface.

*This whole project utilizes the fade-in visual feature a lot, for it focuses on creating a very smooth visual interface in combination with a very minimalist/simplistic design 

- Whenever the INITIAL value is 0, the program will not show any sort of percentage change (will show a difference), as a percentage change from an initial value of 0 is mathematically impossible

If the program was in a state of increase or decrease, the calculator UI will fade BACK to its original colour to signify no percentage change. 

- The program supports an info button feature, which will bring up a pop-up modal of information for the user (works in both light and dark mode)

- Which brings me to the next and last feature, a toggle light-dark mode.

The button in the top-left will toggle a dark-mode feature on the entire program. This also utilizes the smooth fade-in transition to made the change very visually pleasing and smooth (the background transitions at a different time to the calculator to create a more striking effect).
